Find the average absolute fare difference between a specific passenger and all passengers that belong to the same pclass, both are non-survivors and age difference
between two of them is 5 or less years. Do that for each passenger (that satisfy above mentioned coniditions). Output the result along with the passenger name.

CREATE TABLE titanic ( passengerid BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), pclass BIGINT, survived BIGINT, age FLOAT, fare FLOAT, cabin VARCHAR(50),
embarked VARCHAR(1), parch BIGINT, sibsp BIGINT, ticket VARCHAR(50), sex VARCHAR(10));

INSERT INTO titanic (passengerid, name, pclass, survived, age, fare, cabin, embarked, parch, sibsp, ticket, sex) VALUES 
(1, 'John Smith', 1, 0, 35, 71.28, 'C85', 'C', 0, 1, 'PC 17599', 'male'), (2, 'Mary Johnson', 1, 0, 30, 53.1, 'C123', 'C', 0, 0, 'PC 17601', 'female'),

Solution:

 with non_survivors as
 (
 select passengerid,name,pclass,age,fare from titanic where survived=0
 ),
 
 fare_difference as
 (
 select t1.passengerid,t1.name,abs(t1.fare-t2.fare) as fare_diff from non_survivors t1 join non_survivors t2 on t1.pclass=t2.pclass and abs(t1.age-t2.age)<=5 
 and t1.passengerid!=t2.passengerid
 )
 ,
 avg_fare as
 (
 select  passengerid,name,avg(fare_diff) as avg_fare from fare_difference group by passengerid,name 
 )
 
 select name as passenger_name,round(avg_fare,2) as avg_fare from avg_fare order by name


#Output

passenger_name  	avg_fare
Alice Walker	      12.12
Anna Davis        	0
David Thomas	      9.09
Emma Moore	        0.5
John Smith	        12.12
Mary Johnson	      9.09
Robert Wilson	     0
William Taylor	    0.5
