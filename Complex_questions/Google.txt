You are given a transaction table, which records transactions between sellers and buyers.
The structure of the table is as follows: 

| Column         | Data Type | Description                   |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Transaction_ID | INT       | Unique transaction identifier |
| Customer_ID    | INT       | Unique customer identifier    |
| Amount         | INT       | Transaction amount            |
| Date           | TIMESTAMP | Transaction date and time     |

Every successful transaction will have two row entries into the table with two different transaction_id but in ascending order sequence,
the first one for the seller where their customer_id will be registered, and the second one for the buyer where their customer_id will be registered.
The amount and date_time for both will however be the same. 

Write an sql query to find the 5 top seller-buyer combinations who have had maximum transactions between them. 

Condition - Please disqualify the sellers who have acted as buyers and also the buyers who have acted as sellers for this condition.

CREATE TABLE Transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount INT,
    tran_Date DATETIME
);

INSERT INTO Transactions (transaction_id, customer_id, amount, tran_Date) VALUES
(1, 101, 500, '2025-01-01 10:00:01'),

Solution:

with cte as(
select transaction_id,customer_id as seller_id,amount,tran_date, lead(customer_id) over(order by transaction_id) as buyer_id 
from Transactions 
),

combinations as(
select seller_id, buyer_id ,count(*) as total_transactions from cte where transaction_id %2=1 
group by seller_id,buyer_id 
),
fraud_cust as(
select distinct  a.seller_id as fraud_id from combinations a join combinations b on a.seller_id=b.buyer_id
)

select * from combinations  where seller_id not in(select fraud_id from fraud_cust) and buyer_id not 
in(select fraud_id from fraud_cust) ;
