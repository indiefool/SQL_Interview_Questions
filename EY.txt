In a marathon, gun time is counted from the moment of the formal start of the race while net time is counted from the moment a runner crosses a starting line. Both variables are in seconds.

You are asked to check if the interval between the two times is different for male and female runners. First, calculate the average absolute difference between the gun time and net time.
Group the results by available genders (male and female). Output the absolute difference between those two values.

CREATE TABLE marathon_male (age BIGINT, div_tot TEXT, gun_time BIGINT, hometown TEXT, net_time BIGINT, num BIGINT, pace BIGINT, person_name TEXT, place BIGINT);

INSERT INTO marathon_male (age, div_tot, gun_time, hometown, net_time, num, pace, person_name, place) VALUES (25, '1/100', 3600, 'New York', 3400, 101, 500, 'John Doe', 1),

CREATE TABLE marathon_female (age BIGINT, div_tot TEXT, gun_time BIGINT, hometown TEXT, net_time BIGINT, num BIGINT, pace BIGINT, person_name TEXT, place BIGINT);

INSERT INTO marathon_female (age, div_tot, gun_time, hometown, net_time, num, pace, person_name, place) VALUES (28, '1/100', 3650, 'San Francisco', 3600, 201, 510, 'Jane Doe', 1),

Solution:


with cte as(
select  avg(abs(net_time-gun_time)) as avg_diff,'male' as gender from marathon_male union all

select  avg(abs(net_time-gun_time)) as avg_diff ,'female' as gender from marathon_female )

select  abs(max(case when gender='male' then avg_diff end)- max(case when gender='female' then avg_diff end)) as absolute_diff  from cte
